== Typical Use Case

Let us go over a common use case. If any section is marked (optional) it can be
skipped if you do not need the feature explained in it.

=== Obtain SCAP content

Even before we start the workbench we need to find content to open. Probably
the best choice right now is scap-security-guide
footnote:[https://fedorahosted.org/scap-security-guide/].

From the package repository (YUM):: # yum install scap-security-guide
From the package repository (APT):: # apt-get install scap-security-guide
From upstream source (not recommended!)::
 . $ git clone https://git.fedorahosted.org/git/scap-security-guide.git ; cd scap-security-guide
 . $ make

==== Alternative SCAP content (optional)
[[alternative-contents]]
 * http://usgcb.nist.gov/usgcb/rhel_content.html[USGCB for RHEL5] - XCCDF and OVAL, only suitable for RHEL5.
 * https://fedorahosted.org/sce-community-content/[SCE Community Content] - Uses SCE, only suitable for Fedora.

=== Start scap-workbench

After installation a new application entry for scap-workbench should appear
in your desktop environments application menu.

[[img-starting-scap-workbench]]
.scap-workbench application entry in GNOME 3
image::starting_scap_workbench.png[align="center"]

In case you cannot find any scap-workbench application icon / entry to click,
press Alt+F2 to bring up the run command dialog (works in Gnome 3 and KDE 4),
type 'scap-workbench' and confirm.

scap-workbench should start and if you installed scap-security-guide from
your package repository, workbench will immediately open it without any
interaction being necessary.

[[img-default-content-opened]]
.Default content opened in workbench
image::default_content_opened.png[align="center"]

=== Open Different Content (optional)

Clicking *Browse* will enable you to change opened content. Keep in mind that
workbench only supports opening XCCDF and Source DataStream files. Everything
else will result in an error dialog being shown.

****
Only one content file can be opened by a single scap-workbench instance.
Opening a different content file will *DESTROY* all your tailoring changes
and you will also *LOSE* profile selection.
****

To prevent workbench from opening default content when it starts you can either
uninstall it or pass a different path via command line.

 scap-workbench PATH_TO_SCAP_CONTENT

See <<alternative-contents, alternative contents>> for more content choices.

=== Load a Ready-made Tailoring File (optional)

In case you were given a tailoring file for your specific evaluation use-case,
you can load by clicking on the *Tailoring file* combobox and selecting the *(open tailoring file...)*
option. This will bring up a file open dialog where you can select your
tailoring file.

****
Loading a tailoring file will *DESTROY* all your tailoring changes that you
have done either by customizing profiles or loaded from another tailoring
file.
****

****
Only XCCDF 1.2 supports tailoring officially. The openscap project has an extension
that allows tailoring files to be used with XCCDF 1.1 so scap-workbench supports
that as well. The details are out of scope of this document.
****

[[img-opening-tailoring-file]]
.Opening a tailoring file
image::opening_tailoring_file.png[align="center"]

=== Choose a Profile

****
XCCDF profiles are in essence configurations of the content for a particular
evaluation scenario. XCCDF profiles decide which rules are selected and which
values they use - e.g.: one profile may enforce password length to be at least 10
characters, a different one may be more lenient and enfore password length of
at least 6 characters.

For more details refer to the
http://scap.nist.gov/specifications/xccdf/index.html[XCCDF specification].
****

Every SCAP content will have at least one profile - the *(default)* profile
which is an empty profile that does not change selection of any rules and
does not affect values passed to any of the checks. Only rules with the
selection attribute equal to "true" and all their ancestor Group selection
attribute also being "true" are evaluated in a (default) profile.

The (default) profile is very unlikely the choice you want to use though,
so scap-workbench will only choose it implicitly if there are no other profiles.
By default the first profile that is not the default profile will be chosen.

Use the *Profile* combobox to change which profile will be used for subsequent
evaluation. When scap-workbench is not evaluating it previews selected rules
of current profile in the list labeled *Selected Rules*. This list will
refresh every time you customize a profile or select a different one.

=== Customize the Selected Profile (optional)

After you have selected the profile suitable for your desired evaluation you
still may want to make slight alterations to it. Most commonly it would be
deselecting that one undesirable rule that makes no sense on this particular
machine.

Make sure your desired profile is selected and click *Customize*.

[[img-customizing-ssg-profile]]
.Customizing scap-security-guide's "common" profile
image::customizing_ssg_profile.png[align="center"]

A new modal dialog will be spawned, you cannot interact with the rest of the
application until you finish your tailoring changes.

In our example case we do not care about minimum and maximum age for passwords
and do not want the rules failing for our configuration. Let us expand the
tree until we find the offending rules and unselect both of them.

[[img-tailoring-dialog-opened]]
.Unselecting minimum and maximum password age rules
image::tailoring_dialog_opened.png[align="center"]

****
This tailoring dialog supports undo/redo. If you accidentaly make changes that
you want to undo, press CTRL+Z or click the *Undo* button.

Keep in mind that the undo history will get lost when you press *Finish tailoring*!
****

After desired tailoring changes are done, click *Finish tailoring* to get back
to the previous GUI.

=== Save tailored content (optional)

The content that you carefully tailored can be saved for later deployment.

==== Save just the tailoring file

Click *Save Tailoring* and choose the destination file. Workbench will save just
tailoring which you can use with the content you opened.

****
If XCCDF version of the content is lower than 1.2 footnote:[Tailoring is not officially
supported in XCCDF 1.1.x, the feature has been added in 1.2] workbench will create
a file that is not compliant to the official specification! openscap and scap-workbench
support Tailoring in XCCDF 1.1.4 through an extension. Keep in mind that such content
will work in openscap powered tools but may not work in tools from other vendors!
****

==== Save all content into a directory

Click *Save content* and choose *Save into a directory*. After selecting the destination
directory scap-workbench will export both input content and a tailoring file into the
directory.

==== Save as RPM

Click *Save content* and choose *Save as RPM*. After selecting the destination
directory scap-workbench will create an RPM in that directory. This RPM will contain
both input content and a tailoring file.

****
Please note that the resulting RPM will not be signed! This means that it can be rejected
for deployment by system management tools like Spacewalk.

If you wish to sign the resulting RPM, make sure you have *rpm-sign* installed,
the */usr/bin/rpmsign* binary available and GPG as well as related rpmmacros setup.
footnote:[Please see http://fedoranews.org/tchung/gpg/ for a detailed write-up on how to sign RPMs]
Then execute:

$ rpm --addsign my-content-1.1.rpm

The resulting package will be signed and ready to use provided that your desired
system management tool accepts the key you used.
****

=== Choose the Target Machine

scap-workbench will scan *local machine* by default. However you can also
scan remote machines using ssh.

To scan a remote machine, select *remote machine (over ssh)* in the *Target*
combobox. A pair of input boxes will appear. Input the desired username and
hostname and select proper port. Make sure the machine is reachable, selected
user can login over ssh and has enough privileges to evaluate the machine.

****
The target machine has to have the *oscap* tool of version 0.8.0 or greater
installed and in $PATH!
****

****
Only a Source DataStream can be used to scan a remote machine. Plain XCCDF
is not supported yet!
****

[[img-scanning-remote-machine]]
.Selecting a remote machine for scanning
image::scanning_remote_machine.png[align="center"]

=== Enable Online Remediation (optional)

****
Remediation is an automatic attempt to change configuration of the scanned
machine in a way that fixes a failed rule result. By fixing we mean changing
configuration, ensuring that the rule would pass in the new configuration.

The success of automatic remediation greatly depends on content quality and
could result in broken machines if not used carefully!
****

The *Online Remediation* checkbox will do remediation as part of the evaluation
itself. After evaluation is done, *oscap* will go over failed rules and attempt
to remedy each of them.

The rules that were remedied will show up as *fixed* in the rule result list.

=== Evaluate

Everything is set up now we can start the evaluation. Click the *Scan*
button to start evaluation. If you selected a remote machine target ssh
may ask you for a password at this point.

****
scap-workbench never processes your ssh password in any way. Instead a ssh
process is spawned which itself spawns the ssh-askpass program which asks
for the password.
****

If you selected to scan the local machine, workbench will show a dialog
that allows you to authenticate and scan the machine with superuser rights.
You can click cancel if you wish to scan using your current permissions.

The application now starts the *oscap* tool and waits for it to finish,
reporting partial results along the way in the rule result list. Keep in mind
that the tool cannot guess how long will processing of any particular rule
take. Only the amount of rules that have been processed and the amount that
is remaining are used to estimate progress. Please be patient and wait for
oscap to finish evaluation.

****
You can cancel the scan at any point by clicking the *Cancel* button. Canceling
will only give you partial results in the evaluation progress list, you cannot
get ARF or XCCDF results if you cancel evaluation!
****

After you press the *Scan* button all the previous options will be disabled
and greyed-out. You cannot change them until you press the *Clear* button
which will drop all results.

=== View and Analyze Results

After evaluation finishes you should see two new buttons - Clear and Results.

****
Pressing Clear will *permanently* destroy scan results! This action cannot
be undone.
You can save the results as either ARF or XCCDF to keep them for later
analysis.
****

Pressing Results will bring up a new window. In case scap-workbench was compiled
with WebKit support you should see the HTML report right in the application.
Otherwise, press *Open HTML report* to open the report using your internet
browser.

****
scap-workbench will open the report in the default web browser set in your
desktop environment. Make sure you have a browser installed.

If nothing happens after pressing the button, check which browser is the default.
See System Settings -> System Info -> Default Applications in GNOME 3 or
System Settings -> Default Applications in KDE4.

In case you still can't get scap-workbench to open a browser, simply save the
report to a HTML file on your hard drive and open it as any different HTML file.
****

[[img-browsing-results]]
.Browsing results
image::browsing_results.png[align="center"]

Your evaluation results can be saved in several formats:

HTML report:: Human readable and convenient, not suitable for machine processing.
Can be examined by any web browser.
XCCDF result:: Machine readable file with just the results, not suitable for
manual processing. Requires a special tool that can parse the format.
ARF:: Also called result datastream. Packs input content, asset information
and results into a single machine readable file, not suitable for manual processing.
Requires a special tool that can parse the format.

If you are unsure which format to choose for result archiving you can choose
*Save XCCDF Result*. It is commonly supported and you can easily generate
an HTML report from it using the *oscap* tool.
